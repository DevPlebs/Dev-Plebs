## ðŸ‘” Conventional Commits

This project follows [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) specifications. The Husky `commit-msg` hook checks that commit messages adhere to these standards using [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint).
